# WorkDayScheduler
MSU - Homework 05: Work Day Scheduler (Third Party APIs)

For this project I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. I used the Moment.js library to work with date and time. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
